# find 指令 

find 指令将从指定目录向下递归地遍历其各个子目录，将满足条件的文件或者目录显示在终端。

find /home/one/ -name python1.txt：按照指定目录下面进行查询执行文件

find /opt -user one：查找/opt 目录下，用户名称为 one的文件

find / -size +200M  +n 大于 -n  小于 n 等于, 单位有 k,M,G

# locate

locate XXX：查找指定文件的文件目录

# grep

Grep命令主要用于从文件中查找指定的字符串。

首先建一个demo_file:

```
$ cat demo_file
THIS LINE IS THE 1ST UPPER CASE LINE IN THIS FILE.
this line is the 1st lower case line in this file.
This Line Has All Its First Character Of The Word With Upper Case.

Two lines above this line is empty.
And this is the last line.
```

例01:从单个文件中查找指定的字符串

```
$ grep "this" demo_file
this line is the 1st lower case line in this file.
Two lines above this line is empty.
```

例02:从多个文件中查找指定的字符串

```
$ grep "this" demo_first demo_first1
demo_first:this line is the 1st lower case line in this file.
demo_first:Two lines above this line is empty.
demo_first:And this is the last line.
demo_first1:this line is the 1st lower case line in this file.
demo_first1:Two lines above this line is empty.
demo_first1:And this is the last line.
```

例03:忽略大小写使用 grep -i

```
$ grep -i "the" demo_file
THIS LINE IS THE 1ST UPPER CASE LINE IN THIS FILE.
this line is the 1st lower case line in this file.
This Line Has All Its First Character Of The Word With Upper Case.
And this is the last line.
```

例04:在文件中匹配正则表达式

匹配了所有以lines开头,以empty结尾的行。

```
$ grep "lines.*empty" demo_file
Two lines above this line is empty.
```

例05:用grep -w来查找全匹配,不包括子字符串

```
$ grep -iw "is" demo_file
THIS LINE IS THE 1ST UPPER CASE LINE IN THIS FILE.
this line is the 1st lower case line in this file.
Two lines above this line is empty.
And this is the last line.
```
